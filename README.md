# Novafutur Weather App
This repository is for the completion of the Novafutur tech test to create a Weather App.

## Annika's Notes:
All components have been tested and are passing all tests. I have kept to the wireframe as closely as possible and built mobile first, the design only alters very slightly for a larger view. 

### Additional Notes:
This app was built in React. In order to run it on your local machine you must do a 'yarn install' in the CLI to install all packages. All tests can be run on the command 'yarn test' and to view the app it is 'yarn start'.

Additionally, I have not concealed the API keys due to the nature of this project, however you can see how I have concealed API keys in my repository [travel-project](https://github.com/AnnikaChauhan/travel-project).

## Reflection
If I had more time to complete this project, I would have liked to fulfil the bonus of the brief. I have a rough idea of what I would have liked to do but I'm not sure how it would work exactly and would take some time to learn. I would also have liked to add some additional features for the user by including search functionality and potentially a toggle for a light and dark mode - to give the user a more personal experience. 

Although I solved this by using setIntervals/Timeouts to refresh the data, I would have ideally liked to learn how to use webSockets as I have read that this is a much more efficient way to have a constantly updating API request. I am aware this requires a greater knowledge of Node.js and I have begun taken the steps to gain a more knowledge by completing online tutorials. Some of my latest learnings are publically available on my GitHub.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
